PROJECT GOAL
Author classification of sentences measured by mean multi-class logarithmic loss

DATASET
Collection of English sentences, with punctuation, and author labels

FEATURE ENGINEERING IDEAS

- Possible embeddings for sequence to multi-class model
	- NMF of sentence-term count matrix
	- SVD of sentence-term count matrix
	- Glove (term co-occurrences)
	- Skip-gram Word2Vec (term embeddings)
	- Fastext (term embeddings with subword information)
	- POS encoding

- Basic statistics for 
	- Mean word length
	- Variance of word length
	- Punctuation count
	- Word count
	- Letter count
	- N-Grams counts
